# Hacking APIs

- SelfEcho: platform for aggregating/correlating data
- lots of mobile interest (naturally), but also spread/macro effects
  - how do habits spread?
  - what are differentials between regions?
- correlation: tie together multiple APIs, mashups on steroids
  - what are problems?
    - who owns data? who owns analysis?
    - time series correlation: how do you normalize that into a single interchange format?
    - vendor/service lockdown: twitter, netflix, etc. limiting access to key parts of your data
    - marketing vs. developers: former want CSV/Excel, latter wants XML/JSON
      - but: both are APIs!
      - the format of data is important, because different users want different formats
- interesting services
  - if this then that: perform triggered actions across services (ifttt.com)
  - zapier: sync data between services (zapier.com)
  - wahoo fitness: wireless smartphone <-> sensor connection
  - Personal Data Ecosystem Consortium
  - Open mHealth: pushing "mobile health" forwards...
- what do we want?
  - more raw data: why do we only get *some* of our data out of these services?
  - coreutils: complete manipulation freedom via a set of simple utilities
    - e.g. when i pass a certain threshold X, do Y
  - data provenance: how did this data get here?
    - where did it come from?
    - what was done to it, and by who/what?
- what properties are useful in a QS tool?
  - standardized format? (but why not just use JSON? no standardized metadata...)
    - OData: Microsoft's foray into normalizing this metadata
      - looks like the bastard child of SQL and REST
  - timestamp resolution
  - a way to share analyses: API for sets of filters, transformations, etc.
  - provenance
