# Plenary Session 

## Robin Brook

- 2006-2007: heavy stress + extreme caffeine intake
- decided to reduce intake gradually
  - confront problem with quitting: dependency
  - first: feels more relaxed
  - then: feels more lethargic
- 2009: also kept productivity diary (caffeine reduction -> more productive?)
  - corollary: we're really bad at analyzing our subjective experience
  - data mitigates this effect
    - seeing the data is *especially* helpful
- also tried meditation practice, graphed amount of meditation time per day
  - peaks: areas of high (intrinsic? extrinsic?) motivation
  - troughs: depression -> saw that coffee is protective against depression
- 2010-2011: restarted coffee
  - less extreme: troughs/peaks are shallower (protection effect)
  - but: doesn't help with acute life events (e.g. death of close relative)

## Davis

- positively impact mid-century world: 10B ppl
  - top of scientific hierarchy is critically important
- citizen science: are we ready to have 10B ppl do science with their smartphones?
  - today's smartphones have 4-6 sensors; tomorrow's will have ~15
  - city has ~1B sensors, will have ~10B by 2020
    - data exhaust: can we collect/process all this meaningfully?
- help others by helping ourselves
  - we find personal insights, then wonder if they can generalize to wider audiences

## Gary Wolff

- QS is not an "industry", it is a culture/practice/community
  - reminds me of parkour (which has as its indirect goal deeper engagement with urban environments)
- interested in how habits break down
  - easy to start, hard to not stop
  - reverse graph: how many days were skipped? what's the longest skip run?
    - relapse -> loss of confidence -> adjusts P(won't start tomorrow | didn't start today)
  - seasonal pattern in missing days!
    - important to know *how* to track our data
    - seeing this data turned the feeling of bitter failure into a gradual move towards success
- what is QS?
  - Q: data, numbers, etc.
  - S: not many people are working on this!
    - what is computing for? used to be operational/scientific, now personal/social
    - what do *users* want to do vs. what do *people*/*we* want to do?
    - why are people who speak in the first person more open/collaborative?
  - "there's plenty of room at the bottom": Feynman
    - when you think on a different scale, challenges mutate or change entirely
    - "big data": misnomer, because it suggests personal data is "little data"
      - "ourness" vs. "bigness": *our* data has context
      - standard answer to context-free: get more data -> get *all* the data!
      - but what is *all*? maybe scale isn't the right spectrum

## Nancy Dory: Technology and Mindfulness

- QS is a very mindful community
  - mindful? "regulating attention to moment, observing w/o judgment"
  - "wasteland of empty online biometric profiles"
  - gathering data allows you to interpret it in terms of your life
- *tracking* habits themselves are influenced by mental/emotional state
  - but! tracking data influences tracking itself
  - also! tracking influences mental/emotional state
    - awareness of patterns/outliers
  - well-known effect: mindfulness reduces stress, etc.
- technology: can draw us outside ourselves
  - but not technology's fault: we should control it, rather than having it control us
  - QS: a means for regaining that control!
- Calming Tech Lab (Stanford): finding some of these points where we lose control
  - "email apnea": when we check email, we sometimes reduce breathing (or stop entirely!)
- string of lights that blinks when smiling
  - gives her feedback, but also creates a unit of engagement for others
- questions:
  - is smiling always good? can one smile too much?
    - not intimidating to have feedback: creating a reason to smile is important
  - emphasis on modelling emotions, closing loop with technology so we can engineer emotions...how do you see what you're doing?
    - looking for signal amplification on emotional state
    - start to feel happy -> LEDs blink -> positive feedback loop!
    - don't smile for too long -> LEDs blink -> negative feedback loop!
    - "data environment": maybe knowledge of this state is important for others as well!
