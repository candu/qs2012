# Saturday Closing Talks

## Wearable Sensing

- mc10: soft, stretchy wearable electronics
- what sensors are you putting in your wearables?
  - basically, anything you can do with semiconductors :p
  - low-power sensors are better
  - use sensors for particular types of insight
    - as opposed to indiscriminately gathering data
- what can we do with these sensors?
  - now: first-order things (steps, acceleration, etc.)
  - more precisely: what will we sense that we can't currently?
    - athletics/fitness
      - pedometry is a *really* coarse way of tracking output
      - start to sense joint angles, hydration, etc.: prevent injury!
    - better activity monitoring
      - *activity* is more than just taking steps!
- what is your role in making these wearables?
  - are you trying to take control of the whole thing? or provide a platform?
  - what makes a great wearable product?
    - widespread use
    - habitual use
  - can I query my shirt? or am I limited to queries that you decide are important?
    - the raw data is *a lot* for most people
- vision: to make these platforms as open and accessible as possible
  - currently sharp focus on hardware: make it reliable!
    - how to deal with sweat? exposure to elements? cosmetics?
- powering these devices...how?
  - grab data from phone
  - what about solar? piezoelectric?
    - problem: these are not widespread; phone "power hygiene" is
- what's the "size" limit on these devices? (complexity?)
  - size matters, small is better
  - prefer to find the "best body real-estate" for collecting data
- places that are off-limits (cost, safety)
  - inside the body: more permanent sensing
  - vitals: "where the doctor puts their hands"
    - physical exam is difficult to replicate outside the doctor's office!
- what's the potential for real-time feedback?
  - not necessarily via analytics engines, but via *actuators*
  - usually, "wearables" == "wearable sensing"
    - we forget about wearable *feedback*!
  - e.g. shoes that vibrate for balance, belts that tell you where North is...
  - main feedback mechanisms: sound, light, vibration
    - give opportunity to build *trained responses*
