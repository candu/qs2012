# Lunch Ignite Talks

## Jason Langheer (Zipongo): Tailored meals to keep me healthy

- tracking routines: being intentional
- behavioral economics: how to tweak the value functions to promote "good" behavior?
- QS data is an *input* that drives future behavior
- j@zipongo.com

## Charles Wang, MD: Self Tracking, Self Awareness, and Change

- motivating example: psychiatrist must decide whether to release patient from hospital
  - mostly subjective/intuitive now
  - gathering data: what if that decision could be (partially) based on that?
- another example: 40% of back surgeries do not solve pain
  - can we make people mindful of their posture? enter Lumoback
  - track slouch vs. non-slouch, provide instant feedback
- charles@lumoback.com

## Dave Marvit (Fujitsu): Use of a generalized data tracking platform in PTSD

- generalized platform for tracking sensor data: Sprout
- example: tracking biometrics alongside location
  - power of correlating datastreams
  - stress level during morning/evening commute
- trained response: invoking meditation techniques subconsciously
  - what you can measure, you can manage

## Daniel Nofal (wikilife): An Open and Integrated Platform for Self-Tracking

- our knowledge of health is still limited
  - information is fragmented, biased, un-normalized
  - QS can end this!
- but! QS is focussed on individual
  - answer: individual -> social (Quantified Mass)

## Ron Gutman: How Data (almost) Saved My Life

- self-experimentation is complicated!
  - how do you tease out correlations, patterns, etc. ?
  - how do you figure out what works for you?
- start simple: Pareto 80/20-style
  - unexpected results come from paying attention (mindfulness!)
  - e.g. stress: water, simple dietary modifications

## David Featherstonhaugh (IDEO): Our Quantified Run

- Quantified Us (ref. Quantified Mass)
  - how do you take existing groups and use tracking to amplify their connection/coherence?
- experiment: Quantified Shirt
  - 5K run; team wore a "survey on a shirt"
  - each person records data on the shirt via Sharpie
  - use the shirts as a tool for engagement
    - but! only 52% responded
- most people aren't like us!
  - measurement is a lousy invitation to engagement!
  - *why* are they measuring?
- Hawthorne Effect
  - changes during a study may be related only to the special social situation created during the study

## Greg Schwartz: Burning BodyMedia - Calories burned in SF and at Burning Man

- wore BodyMedia before and after Burning Man
  - measures caloric output using galvanic skin response
  - can't measure everything: e.g. fire poi practice
  - weekends are more intense (avg. 3500/weekday, 3750/weekend)
  - BM: 4500-5700/day
- when do I burn the most?
  - wore BodyMedia sensor once during fire poi: 13 cal/min
- how do you define a "day"?
  - BodyMedia counts midnight
  - but! sleep is a more natural place to split days
