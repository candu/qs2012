## Breakout - Habit Design

- Michael Kim: Habit Design, Kairos Labs, ex-Microsoft (XBOX, social software)
  - kairoslabs.com
    - Kairos: the moment your effort turns to achievement
  - opportunity in integrating games and behavior change
  - Behavior Change Games
  - Habit Design: like QS community, but focussed ONLY on practice/mastery of daily habits
- benchmark: something you've done for 100 days
  - existing thresholds are subjective: some say 21 days, others ~60, etc.
  - *design*: what makes a good habit? what makes a good approach to habit forming?
- vimeo.com/channels/habitdesign
- QS does not yet create habits!
  - tracking is a great starting point if you're already motivated
  - but! simply tracking is NOT enough
    - how do you get people who aren't already motivated?
    - how do you retain people who were motivated?
    - create, enable, sustain motivation
- Hawthorne Effect: act of observing factory workers improved performance
  - but! Steven Levitt: effect may not actually exist, even looking at the original data
- "muggle chasm": QS is for alpha-male geek wizards
  - how to cross this chasm? how to make this generally accessible?
  - focus on *habits* and *behavior*, not *data*
- smartphones: behaviorism is making a comeback
- power of social effects
  - community -> accountability
  - familiarity -> comfortableness
- fitocracy: levelling up helps, but only to a point
  - gamification is not a silver bullet; its value depreciates
  - fitocracy is actually moving away from gamification!
- tracking can harm you!
  - if you lose track of your goal, having that behavior is demotivating
  - streaks vs. point data
- The Habit Game
  - follow this hashtag
  - make a tweet with this hashtag when you do something
- book: Willpower (Kelly McGonigal)
- behavior requires sufficient ability, motivation, and triggers
  - how important is willpower? willpower is a muscle
    - one side: it gets stronger the more you use it! (long-term)
    - the other: it becomes exhausted the more you use it! (short-term)
  - Obama: withhold willpower, saving it for *very* important choices
    - program your day where possible
    - go to gym at same time, wear same clothes each day, etc.
  - Michael Phelps: following habit routine; the race is just the end of a successful habit sequence
- mindfulness vs. willpower?
  - mindfulness evokes curiosity: *detached* wanting to do something
  - willpower is targeted: *involved* wanting to do something
  - exploratory vs. goal-oriented
- habit loop: cue -> routine -> reward -> cue...
  - gamification: reward! (but what about cue? routine?)
  - what are some tactics that focus on cue? routine?
  - how can we combine those tactics?
- cultural differences
  - results: Americans are very results-oriented
  - rest of world: focus on the process, the community/collective effort)
- science of small wins:
  - dopamine response is non-linear: 5 minutes of walking has the same perceived dopamine effect as 10
  - so figure out what the smallest win is to achieve that, and do it!
- how do you address a negative habit?
  - replace the routine, keep the cue
  - a sort of judo for habits: use the energy of that cue to drive positive routines!
  - how do you figure out the cue? the routine substitution?
    - how can we short-circuit the experimentation loop?
    - accumulating that data from many people (e.g. Kairos)
- meta-note: a LOT of this discussion is essentially Duhigg's The Power Of Habit rehashed...
- staving off compulsive behavior:
  - take orange, toss it between hands while watching it for 90 seconds
  - this successfully breaks the cue -> routine link
- B.J.Fogg's Tiny Habits Program
