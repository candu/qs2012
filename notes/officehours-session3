## Discussion with David Horn

- works in social media data analytics for Disney
  - trying to gauge brand sentiment/virality across all of Disney's ~600 brands
  - using Twitter, FB, etc. to determine sentiment, find influencers, tease out regional effects
- similar to WalmartLabs problem: can we anticipate product demand?
- aggregate social data: bypasses many of the privacy concerns
  - e.g. Target pregnancy prediction
  - concern over "OMG, they know what I want!": creepy
- big companies aren't incentivized to open up their data completely
  - b/c a substantial part of the value in that data is in the analytics
  - if you had the analytics, you could replicate Facebook (or other services)
- verticals in self-tracking
  - UX: how do we make the process of data entry painless?
  - gamification: how do we offset the pain of data entry by offering a reward?
    - social as a subset: likes and comments *are* points
  - hardware: how do we make data entry automatic?
  - analysis: how do we make data entry ultimately meaningful to people?
- vertical vs. horizontal approach
  - vertical: pick one and own it
    - e.g. Yahoo FireEagle: general platform for entering location data
    - but they forgot the important question: *why* would I enter my location data?
  - horizontal: do all of these, possibly in an imperfect manner
    - seems more successful
    - provides the means, process, and purpose for data entry *at once*
    - without all three, data entry falls apart
