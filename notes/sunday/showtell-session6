# Session 6 - Show & Tell Talks

## Jo Beth Dow - Patterns of my Achy Breaky HRV Heart

- Sweet Beat (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sweetbeat/id492588712?mt=8)
- what's HRV?
  - heart rate variability
  - higher is better (why?)
- positive effects
  - acupuncture, qi gong
  - healthy diet, quality sleep
  - diaphragmatic breathing
- negative effects
  - alcohol: lower stress while drinking, much higher the morning after
    - even at lower doses (1 drink vs. 2-3 drinks)
  - stress: clear correlation between negative events (death, disease) and lowered HRV

## Elliot Hedman - Using Physiological Measurements at Classical Concerts to Learn What Excites Me

- questioning the assumptions
  - maybe QS should be a little less quantified!
  - maybe QS should be a little less self!
  - maybe we should look at small datasets!
- skin conductance during symphonic classical concert
  - crazy loud part did not incite arousal! sudden change to soft did
  - effect observed across a number of people
- specific personal effects
  - xylophone: speaker played this, so familiarity elicits response
- correlating video and response
  - less quantified: seeing just the graphs means nothing without the context
    - consider qualitative! photos, videos, unstructured notes that you can interpret
  - less self: compare yourself to others
    - how are you similar? how are you different?
  - smaller time frame
    - data from one 45-minute concert
    - micro-level details!

## Lisa Betts-LaCroix - Tales of Weight Tracking

- QS impostor syndrome
  - "I've been tracking for a long time, but I'm *bad* at it!"
  - remember that most people are NOT scientists, self-professed geeks, etc.
  - how to know what to track? what not to track?
- Withings scale
  - finally successful: removed some of the emotional aspect of weight tracking
