- record webcam, screen, location every hour
  - passive tracking!
  - since we spend most of our waking time on the computer, can also infer sleep!
  - productivity!
- question of scale
  - zoom in: see individual days
  - zoom out: see hard disk failure, sleep *patterns*
- tracking is a mirror looking back at yourself
  - e.g. caffeine: it took seeing the data to appreciate the correlation and act on it!
- subjective clustering effects: "spaced out zombie info junkie"
- other webcam hacks
  - detect smiles, save bookmark to delicio.us

## Closing Talk

- "nobody is tracking the growth of their toenails...yet."
  - except someone in the audience was.
  - we're expanding the horizon of what can be tracked constantly
  - as we do that, we expand the sense of the "self"
    - extended self
- being surrounded by displays of raw data is NOT what we want
  - that's what computers are good at! we're not so great at it
  - sound, light, vibration/touch: pre-attentive features
    - sense of North: Eric Boyd
    - activate senses directly
    - graphs, charts, etc. are only intermediaries in data transfer...
  - *Qualified* Self
- Quantified Self is happening in the context of a datasphere
  - everything "gives off" data!
  - everything *around you* "gives off" data!
    - e.g. CCTV cameras *also* track you, your location
- "your cell phone is a tracking device you can make calls with"
- question: are we self-quantifiers, or the self-quantified?
  - are we active or passive participants in this tracking?
  - should we be active, or is it alright to be passive?
- QS math: k*(N=1) >> N=k
  - k independent experiments are superior to one k-person experiment
  - drastic shift in scientific method: how do you normalize? control? sample randomly?
- Quantified Us/Community
  - mass: you can "crowdsource" tracking
  - environment: you can track neighborhoods, cities, societies, nations...
  - groups: people can track together, using tracking as one part of the community bond
- again: quantified is *intermediate* step!
  - the step where these new exo-senses are disseminated
    - ref: "the future is here, it's just not evenly distributed"
  - apply AI: the AI becomes an extra sense, something that guides us
- Drucker: "that which is not measured cannot be managed."
  - science: measuring *without fooling ourselves*
  - better tools (telescopes, microscopes in the past; sensors in the present...what next?)
    - new ways to measure, new ways to better ourselves
    - might not always know the *how* of betterment: so just start tracking!
  - s/oil/data/g, s/gold/data/g
- 276 exabytes: the sum of all capacity across all storage media on earth
  - DNA (or other nanomaterial) storage? how else to contain explosion?
  - does bigger == more complicated? (problems of scale)
  - "dark data" (ref. dark matter)
    - most data is exhaust: unconnected, unrelated, unprocessed
    - currently we can't connect all this data quickly enough!
    - also: most of it may not actually have value...
      - but who decides what does or does not have value?
- but! data != gold
  - data can be shared, gold can't: economics are different
  - Quantified Self: two intangibles at the forefront of intangible-ness
  - ownership doesn't work as a concept in the intangible economy!
    - the more I give it away, the more valuable it becomes
    - access >> ownership (but who provides access?)
  - what about privacy? surveillance vs. personalization
    - being *more* transparent enables personalized service/treatment!
    - but! sees personalization as something that is *done to you*
- data == letters
  - as you structure letters, you gain rights and duties
  - as you structure data, you gain rights and duties
- how to prevent pathologies of the commons?
  - communism: the state owns everything (and so it is NOT for humanity)
  - tragedy of the commons: resource is ignored or abused
