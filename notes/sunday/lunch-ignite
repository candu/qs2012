# Sunday Lunch - Ignite Talks

## Hint Hobeika - Evolution of the Butterfleye Swimming Sensor

- swimming: how to track?
  - manual heart rate after each workout
  - tech: Butterfleye (http://butterfleyeproject.com/), uses temporal artery (forehead)
  - goggle-mounted
- feedback informs mood, especially *reliability* of feedback
  - we don't like unexpectedly random rewards!
- body optimization: her heart rate while swimming is ~10 BPM lower than running at same intensity
  - ref: optimization for cycling
  - probably related to muscle consumption/processing of oxygen?

## Jan Peter Larsen - Common Sense Activities App

- sensor data in smartphone: great possibilities for tracking without additional equipment!
  - ref: plenary...15 sensors within the decade
- automated tracking for different types of activities
  - vs. fitbit, which measures walking/running well...and everything else poorly
- how to track in a low-power manner?
  - bursts: high-frequency sampling in intervals
    - b/c wireless radio must activate/cool-down around each data transfer
  - process locally (on-device) where possible, prevent communication
  - upload via wi-fi
- jp@sense-os.nl
- app store: activity sensor (Android version?)

## Natalie McKeever - Internal Worlds: Experiencing the Biological Rhythm of Another Species

- self: voluntary (body) vs. involuntary (mind) processes?
  - is body/mind the right conceptual split here?

## David Albert, MD - A Clinical-Quality, Low-Cost Mobile ECG

- entrepreneurship is NOT mutually exclusive with academic research!
- can we perform tests that usually take highly-specialized equipment with smartphones?

## Yasmin Lucero - Ellie's Log

- detailed records of infant behavior
  - sleep
    - 14.5 hours, drops off around 6 months of age
    - daytime sleep drops off sharply, compensated by a rise in nighttime sleep
      - is this a circadian rhythm learning process?
    - highly consistent
- remember: tracking can be applied to just about anything/anyone!
  - including those who can't track themselves...

## Anne Wright - Data Aggregation and Exploration with Fluxtream/BodyTrack

- "human systems debugging": another linguistic take on self-quantification
- exploration of data
  - small multiples: show time-series in "channel view" (like audio processing tools!)
  - map view: *where* did it happen?
  - photos: subjective/visual information
- having multiple datasets of different sorts helps diagnose problems
  - quick testing of hypotheses

## Paul Abramson - My Experiences Integrating Self-Tracking into Medical Care

- what's wrong with my own health?
  - s/own/patients'/
- tried handing out self-tracking devices to patients
  - problem: patients don't use them! (ref: habit design...more than just technology!)
- quantification coaching
  - like a personal trainer: convinces the patient to use self-tracking techniques!
  - doesn't have the doctor-patient power imbalance
  - reflect/focus on the data
- how to fix health care?
  - top-down: big data
  - bottom-up: self-tracking...patient-centered health care
