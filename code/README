This is some quick-and-dirty data processing for the kinetic sculpture at
QS 2012.

The data format is six-column tab-delimited normalized values. Each row should
represent a single time point (e.g. day, hour, etc.) The file must use DOS
line endings; to do this from Ubuntu, just

sudo apt-get install dos2unix

and then use the unix2dos utility on any file with UNIX line endings.
